Yeah as Simen said. this is the pattern you always need to follow each time you come to a new machine:

1) `git pull` all the commits you sent to github last time you were on the other machine.

2) fix all the `merge` conflicts (if there are any)
3) get on with your coding, `add` and `commit` regularly.
4) Last thing you do before you finish for the day `git push` all your local commits 
from your machine up to github, so you can pull them down from there on your other machine.



Possibly you do have all your old commits on your other machine, but you didn't push them up to github, 
which means the other machine you are on now can't get access to them. @Matthew
