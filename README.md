* Design and Conquer is a website for adventure holiday enthusiasts. Designed for anyone with a passion for travelling, I wanted it to
  be quick and easy to use. A click, choose and select site. Nothing to take the customers experience too far away from the adventure.
  The layout and features of the site are crisp and engaging. the images draw you in and the interactivity of the site showcases
  what you can do. Simply get in touch and go from there. It's cool and engaging for the customer.


[My page](https://mattlister.github.io/designandconquer/)

* A Single Page Application for anyone looking to conquer their next Big Adventure!!

* The project I’ve designed is for my second milestone project for the Interactive FrontEnd Design and Development module of the 
  Full Stack Developer Course. I’ve used Bootstrap to design the HTML layout of the website. This is to provide functionality and a 
  responsive design which sits in an HTML shell with added elements of CSS to add styling. This is a Single Page Applciation (SPA Respectively)
  adventure holiday booking website. The user can use the images to display an API map and see information on each page. There's a "What we do 
  and how to book" option at the top of the page where the user can enquire and book holiday destinations using the request and booking form 
  that will show them how to book and what's available.

## Project Design

* I've designed the website with minimal but engaging colour and content. As it's a single page application, I had to think how I could add 
  a lot of visual information onto one page and not lose anything. The idea I had was for the user to "see something", "like something" and 
  "choose something" It's crisp, clean and the heading stands out at the top with a clever description in the heading of what the website is
  about "Design and Conquer".

### Design


* As you can see in the wireframes section further down, I was originally going to use an orange jumbotron header but it lost something onscreen and
  looked dated. I reviewed other sites that had more freedom in their approach as they weren't single page applications and so could offer more but
  I didn't have that advantage with an SPA. I had to think how to showcase the site without being over worded and was pleasing to view 
  from the outset. It had to stand out and so I came up with the second concept which is on the newer imaged wireframes. The sharp images showed what 
  the website represents straight away. Adventure. 
  
  As they say, a picture paints a thousand words and so to my advantage, I used images and video to show heartstopping moments without many words

### Colours

* A colour scheme of blue presented itself from the main image. It was such a striking coloured picture, it was hard not to use it's natural photographic
  colours to my advantage. The white of the mountains, the bright sun at the top and the skiers bright clothing was just stunning and so I built around this 
  and chose images whic sat well with the background. On the back of the flipped images, I had the idea to use gradients like a window. The sun and blue
  sky showed through a frosted glass perspective which I think kept in with the rest of the design. 

### Images

* Each image used was specifically chosen to showcase that holiday. I chose the idea of images because you instantly know what's 
  represented. whether it's bike riding or shark cage diving. Once an option was chosen, a shadowed grey filter covered the background so the 
  option chosen stands out at the forefront of the design. It was used to hide the background and add focus.

### Styling

* The style of the site as mentioned before is clean, neat and tidy. When landing on the site, everything is interactive so the user can 
  immediately be drawn in from the offset. The images flip when hovered over which then displays the coloured background with Location and 
  Information. 

* When "The Location" option is selected, it displays a map which is the central point of that holiday destination. Click on the "add marker" button and
  markers for each holiday location will be displayed. The user instantly knows where they can go.

* They then hover over the image so if it was Yosamite for instance and they click on location. They have 3 climbs they can experience with Design and 
  Conquer. It's just quick to use.

* To get a taste of what the site offers, if they choose "Information" on the back of the flipped image, some content on the modal which pops up explains what the adventure holds in store. There's also a video which when clicked 
  showcases a users experience of that holiday. Once watched and chosen, they can go to the "What We Do and How to Book" below the header which again, 
  showcases a users video with various adventures into a showreel. There's then a "Booking Here" button under the video which displays
  a booking form. The user can fill it in with some brief information and once done, they click on the "Submit" button and that's when the holiday
  organisers go to work. I was trying to keep everything minimal but engaging without headache and I had to think of each step of the users
  experience.

### Fonts

* I tried and tested various fonts for the site. At the beginning, I had 20 fonts all in one page and over a 2 hour period, tried each one.
  I found the Barrio font to be perfect for the header. Off key, scribbled a little, not quite neat enough. A holiday adventurers font.
  When reviewed within peer review in Slack, the feedback on the font choice was very positive.

* The second font I used, Megrim was again chosen from a long list of font choices. I thought it was cool, sharp and fitted in well with the design 
  of the site. I used this for the smaller content fonts in the modals and it's response wasn't as good so I chose to use it as the smaller headings 
  and description font.

* My third main font used was Oxygen. This was clear, concise and fitted neatly into the modals and all readable sections. 

 * Each font chosen wasn't done on a whim. I started off as explained with around 20 fonts each time I tried something new. Tested and had them all reviewed
   and listened to the response of colleagues, friends, family and then my mentor and reviewers from the peers section in Slack. Each review helped
   me select the font options I have used as they have been postiviely received in each use and instance.


### UX

- I drew up various mock wireframes and initially had a a jumobotron header with a white background and then the 9 images on top. 
- It wasn't bold enough and so a single blown up image with a colourful picture I feel gives it a much bigger impact when viewed by
- a user.


### Project Goals

![](/assets/images/flipimage1.jpg) 


* The primary goal of Design and Conquer is a single page application where a user can book an adventure holiday. As the title indicates, the user
  is able to "design" the adventure and then "conquer" it. There are 9 options on the home page to choose from but an optional form is under the
  What We Do? section where a user can change choose a holiday if needed. The user can watch videos on each slide and read information about the 
  location. There's also a Help Guide on the home page which explains the website and how to use it.




### User Objects

* The website has been designed for people that want to try a new type of holiday that's not on the normal scale. It's also designed for people
 who want to add to their list of adventures.

* Aimed at thrill seekers and people who have a passion for the extraordinary, this site can be used to find that thrill of the unknown. The goals of
  the site are:

* Starting that adventure
* Finding that thrill
* Easy to use
* A clean and neat home page with easily findable information
* Bright and engaging for the user
* Striking images and easily readable content
* Watchable videos that can help a user see what they can achieve

### Design and Conquer helps a user find their passion because:

* The design of the site is to showcase whats available via visual content with description. This helps the user to see what they will
 be able to do when they book the holiday.
 
* It's easy to navigate and book the adventure they want to try. A helpful handy guide is prominent on the home page to stop any confusion.
 Images and map markers showcase the locations so the user know where their adventures take place.


### Developers Objects

* Well stuctured and content friendly with well thought out programming.
* The layout is formatted in a way that the user can navigate around the site without frustration.
* A professionally layed out single page application with includes JavaScript, some JQuery, complex HTML and CSS.
* A site that the developer would use themselves and I will be using the format again for other clients. It will be a forefront of his portfolio.

### Future plans

* Offer more holiday destinations by expanding the adventures and portfolio
* Showcase more self made videos from users about their experiences

### User Stories

* As a user aged between 16 and upwards, I want:

1. The objectives to be met when using the site so there's no confusion and it's easy to navigate around the page.

2. As it's a single page application, I wanted the modals to hold more information and allow me to move around and find new content without leaving
   the page. I was able to showcase more using this technique through visual images and video.

3. As for the vidoes I used for the website, they again displayed so much in a single piece of visual content more than words could. Somebody stepping
   off the plane into the blue. A boat ride out to the sea to be within 2 metres of a Great White Shark. The unbelievable surf of Banzai's coast.
   It engaged me, gave me the thrill to get on the plane and try that adventure for myself and in turn the audience. I could visualise and imagine 
   the destination.

4. Visual images before the box flipped shows you instantly what the adventure is going to be.

5. Stunning videos with inspriing music are used as mentioned before to really showcase the adventure.
 
6. 'The Location' is pinpointed to the heading of the holiday. Seperate markers on the map shows locations where you choose your adventure.


### For the user

1. I want them to find the site enjoyable and engaging.

2. I want it to hold enough information without being too confusing to use. 

3. The idea behind the site is, they find the destination by watching the videos and then contacting us. I travelled to New York this year and
   I went to Virgin (other holiday booking companies are available) to book it. I found going to see them was such a constructive experience. They
   located the hotel, the best places to visit, the sites to see and helped make the entire experience easier before I'd left the travel agents. The 
   idea behind Design and Conquer is the user visits the site, chooses their adventure and contacts the organiser of the site. The organiser then 
   helps to "design" the package which would include travelling, accomodation and insurances. That way, the user would only then need to worry about
   packing their clothes and personal neccesities. Again, the idea behind the site is the user can "see something", "like something" and "choose something". 
   The organiser then puts together options with the user to "design" a personal experience.

4. This design I am also using to create other websites for 2 other companies. 

5. As I will be using the website on my portfolio, easy to find contact information will also be displayed on the site for a user to find.


### Original wireframe concepts

* The wireframes below were the original design I had in mind. A bold header and the images were to be sat on a blank background. How I visualised
  it and how it showed were very different and it was much duller on screen. The images which hadn't been chosen at the time might have brought it 
  into a better light but I reviewed other sites and they either had a similar design or something more dramatic.

* Original Full Screen Design

</p>

* Original Mobile Design

<p align="center">
  <img width="300" height="350" src="/assets/wireframes/orangemob.png">
</p>


* Changing it to a design more along the lines below made an impact straight away. It had colour giving a better overall layout and made
  a difference from the moment I added the background image. Nothing else but that image changed everything. I could then layer over the 
  top of it and add my original plan. I was able to build from the bottom up and show something more with imagery.

</p>


### Flip Image Concept

* When building the original layout, as you can see on the site as it is now, I changed the font to white. It stood out better against
  the blue. Once in place, I could start my concept of building content from one location. I came up with the idea
  of having the flipped image as my original sketch shows. The 9 images and the idea behind the flipped image is at the bottom.
  I think it works well and looks strong on screen.

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" height="250" src="/assets/wireframes/conceptsketch2.png">
</p>

 * To show this as a functioning working project, I attached the following shots below to show the process and fluid nature of the design working.

* Image 1 shows after being selected, the beginning of the image flipping.

### [Home Page](https://github.com/Mattlister/designandconquer)

* Being a SPA, you never leave the one page. You can do everything all in one place and the necessary features come from that starting point.

* All revolving images as stated have a location button which displays the map. The information button holds brief content and a video to watch. 


### Hopes for the website are:

* A user can navigate around the site with ease and simplicity

* The website can be used to find the perfect holiday 

* It allows a user to start their dream and passion

* It's found to be a nice design that allows each user to move around the site comfortably.

* It's clean, clear and easy to use.


 * There will always be bold adventurers looking for something new. Watching the amazing documentary Free Solo, it showcased how far someone
   will go to fill that need and addiction for something different. I wanted this site to be bold, colourful but all in one easy to use
   place. Design and Conquer is a website I was going to add to my portfolio from a few years ago but I neved made it. As a project, I thought this was
   perfect to use for the holiday allowance project for the course and allows me to showcase what I've learnt.

### Site Interactivity and Features



### Technologies Used

### This Project uses the following programming languages

* HTML
* CSS 
* Javascript
* JQuery
* Google Maps
* Google Fonts
* Favicons

* Cloud 9 and AWS Cloud 9

* The same IDE was used but it moved from one product supplier of just Cloud 9 to AWS (Amazon) Cloud 9

* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)

* Bootstrap was used to build a solid and yet simple structure which allowed the site to be responsive easily.

* [Goolge Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

* Google was used for stylising the website fonts as it gave me a great selection to choose from.

 [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)
 
* Autoprefixer was used to correct issues within the CSS which prevented the page displaying on products using Safari and made sure
  all css prefixes were up to date.

* Microsoft Word - I used this product to crop images which I used for my README.md file.

* Vimeo - Searching on Vimeo allowed me to find a strong video for each holiday selection which have only been used for educational purposes.



### The goals for the website are:

* To be seen as an easy to use resource for a holiday adventurer wanting to try something new. Also, it showcases my working knowledge of various software
  languages which I've learnt during the various sections leading up to the MS2 project.

### Ideal site visitors


### This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:

The website has one page that has all navigation and options direct from the one page.

### This website is:

Easy to navigate through.

Allows the user to work through the site with an easy to understand front end design.
Provides the user the information they need without it being overwhelming.
Booking forms and Get in touch forms are clear and concise for when the user wants to book a holiday


## Deployment

This project was developed using the Cloud9 development software originally and then AWS Cloud9. The data is stored in git using the Cloud9 platform.

The project was regularly pushed to GitHub repository https://github.com/Mattlister/designandconquer/commits/master and 
published to GitHub pages using the GitHub settings.

### Deployment to Github

I used and configured GitHub Pages to publish my site's source files from my master branch folder named the-band. This is in Cloud9 folder 
for all my Project Pages that were under that umbrella.

Publishing my source files is dependent on my site type as in what language the code is developed in and the site type I have in 
my repository.

To enable my GitHub Pages to be published, I have a master branch in my repository.

To access my GitHub Pages site's repository.

I access my repository name and click Settings.

Repository settings button

Use the Select source drop-down menu to select master or gh-pages as your GitHub Pages publishing source.

select-gh-pages-or-master-as-source

* Click Save.

* I then Published my GitHub Pages site from my docs folder in my master branch and published the source files from the 
  docs folder in my master branch. I had to have a master branch containing all the data.

* GitHub Pages reads everything when publishing a site, including the CNAME file, from the /docs folder. Every change is updated
 so every step taken and evey edit is documented.


I used default commands to push to Github such as:

* git status when checking what needed uploading.
* git commit -m "" with the named update between the quotes for anyone reading what changes I made. A short piece of info helps understand
* the changes I make.
* git push -u origin master which then pushes my update and I then need to enter my username and password for security.


# Issues whilst building the site

* This site although set me back a few times with various issues when putting the project in place. I originally wrote some in depth JavaScript
  code that displayed the maps, had the content and centralised locations from HTML but I couldn't get more than one location using JavaScript. 
  I originally planned to have 3 locations to choose from each holiday destination. As I looked more indepth, some of the holidays only had 1 option
  available . For instance, there's only 1 Neptune island diving location. Only 1 Victoria falls etc and so I could narrow my locations but still
  couldn't get them to display. So, as a suggestion from my mentor. I created a JSON file and added fetch commands to the JavaScript file. I was able
  to create the For loops and arrays, I could get all the data to read. There were no errors in any of my code or DevTools but the markers would not
  display. I had 3 extra sessions with my mentor. I spent time with tutors looking at this for a week solid but could not figure it out. I then came
  up with the concept that the modals held the information, not the maps. The map was one solid piece of data. The modals were 9 seperate pieces of
  of code. So, I created 9 modals to showcase the maps but this didn't resolve it. The modals still would not show the markers and so I reached out in 
  Slack again. John Longgately who had done the code spotted what I was trying to do. It was hard explaining my situation as it seemed simple. Markers 
  within maps but... the maps had to be seperated and the locations individually added. So, between me and John, we were able to re-write the code 
  altogether and resolve the issue. I could get markers displaying on the maps. Phew!!

* That was amajor milestone but.... I had more to workout because, when I added a centralised location to the modal 1, it worked great. Adding modal
  2 though overwrote the information and so I had to work that out as well. It took me a week to resolve this through various searches and code checks
  to stop the data overwriting when new information was added. I asked one of my peers, Shane Muirhead ro review it and he noticed all the content was
  but as I'd not worked in JavaScript before, he was able to advise me on my hard coded could be streamlined and so with more research and advise, I 
  created the working JavaScript file I have now. 

* I've learnt a great deal on this project and yes, it has taken me longer but I believe I did create something relatively complicated. I only say this
  because when researching what I was doind, the answers weren't always obvious to others. I was able to work through this and keep my head up and keep 
  going to produce what I have now.


## Testing

* I tested the website half way through the project on Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari. I was always using Google Chrome and found no issues when 
using this browser. The website worked to the normal standard on Mozilla Firefox as well. So far, So good. But, On Apple's Safari browser, there were bugs 
displayed. The images when hovered over as you'll see will flip and they'll be a grdient background with both a Location and Information button on the back.
When testing in Safari, the image flipped and stayed as the image but a mirrored version. When the buttons did show, it flipped the image back to the originally
and there was no maps or modals appearing. These are bugs I need to look into but this is a junction I came to mid project.

I used Autoprefixer as explained above to resolve the safari issues I had. I also tested on various iphone formats, ipad tablets and laptops. This inclued Macbook
with Safari and laptops with Windows 10 installed. Tested on various browsers on both laptops to show everything displayed as it should and planned.



### Media and Content

The text, images and videos were found on various sites for each particular venture. 

* The content was taken and used in context from actual sites running these adventures for real and so their write up's were specific for the use of 
  promoting the products.
* The images were searched and found on Google
* The videos were searched for and found on Google. I used Vimeo videos as they're clearer than YouTube videos.


### Code

* I've used various code for this website. As they say, a lazy programmer is a smart programmer so I used some of my code from my 
* MS1 project to start working on this. The Javasctipt was 

* HTML - All code produced by Matthew Lister except for the content such as videos and*  images. These were searched and found on Google Chrome and
then added into iframe and img source code which I had put together. The modal formats and forms were taken from my MS1 and edited to correspond
to the needs of this website. I used script tags from Google Fonts to display the correct formatted fonts.

* CSS - All CSS code was produced by Matthew Lister originally typed to add styling to the HTML page. This included Font styling, image sizing and
colour choices except for the gradients for the back of the flip boxes. This can be found at: http://www.annenbergdl.org/tutorials/easy-breezy-beautiful-css-gradients/
which helps add so much more to the back of the flip boxes. Once I had the code typed up, I ran it through Autoprefixer to clean up and resolve any
breaks which did help in regards to displaying on various sized devices.
 

* JavaScript -

* JSON - The code was produced using information found online on how to produce a JSON file. Once I had the basis, I added more informtion to the 
file to hold multiple markers that will display on the map.





### Acknowledgements

I'd like to say thank you to my mentor Simen Daehlin who has supported me throughout the project and has been a great influence and inspired me to
keep going, especially when I really was ready to throw in the towel but a 10:30 call at night helped get me back on track. The Slack
community reviewed my code and pointed out issues/ offered advice to aide me in improving my sites to produce something greater and so I'm 
really grateful for their consistent support and it's good to know we're in this together. I'd also like to say thank you and acknowledge John Longgately
and Shane Muirhead for their help in regard to issues I had with my Javascript and JQUERY code. And finally, I'd like to say a big thank you to Anna Greaves and 
Anthony O'Brien for their indepth code reviews.

### For my friends currently working on their Milestone 2 projects.

I'm happy if youy'd like to use my readme file as a reference and guide as an example of how to write a strucured milestone project. The format will hopefully
be of use to you but it is not ok to copy directly from mine for your own project. 

Thank you for your understanding,

Kind Regards,

Matthew

### How I’d like the website to be perceived:


* This website would be an easy to use adventure holiday booking site which can be accessed all from one easy location.

* They've seen the locations on TV or in magazines and this is where the user can start their dream holiday.

* A nice clean UX single page design site all sat in one location. Click and point revolving images provide more information and the user never

* leaves the cool holiday home page. Design & Conquer.
