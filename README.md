[My page](https://github.com/Mattlister/designandconquer)

A Single Page Application for anyone looking to conquer their next Big Adventure!!

The project I’ve designed is for my second milestone project for the Interactive FrontEnd Design and Development module of the 
Full Stack Developer Course. I’ve used Bootstrap to design the HTML layout of the website. This is to provide functionality and a 
responsive design which sits in an HTML shell with added elements of CSS to add styling. This is a Single Page Applciation (SPA Respectively)
adventure holiday booking website. The user can use the images to display an API map and see information on each page. There's a "What we do 
and how to book" option at the top of the page where the user can enquire and book holida destinations using the request and booking form 
that will show them how to book and what's available.

### How I’d like the website to be perceived:


* This website would be an easy to use adventure holiday booking site which can be accessed all from one easy location.

* They've seen the locations on TV or in magazines and this is where the user can start their dream holiday.

* A nice clean UX single page design site all sat in one location. Click and point revolving images provide more information and the user never

* leaves the cool holiday home page. Design & Conquer.


# Project Goals and Design

![](/assets/images/flipimage1.jpg) 


The primary goal of Design and Conquer is a single page application where a user can book an adventure holiday. As the title indicates, the user
is able to "design" the advneture and then "conquer" it. There are 9 options on the home page to choose from but an optional form is under the
What We Do? section where a user can change choose a holiday if needed. The user can watch videos on each slide and read information about the 
location. There's also a Help Guide on the home page which explains the website.





# User Goals

The website has been designed for people that want to try a new type of holiday that's not on the normal scale. It's also designed for people
who want to add to their list of adventures and try something new. 


### [Home Page](https://github.com/Mattlister/designandconquer)

Being a SPA, you never leave the one page. You can do everything all in one place and so I've added all the necessary features on the home page.

* All revolving images have an information button about the location and holiday and a map which shows where the area is.


### Hopes for the website are:

A user can use the site with ease and simplicity to the page:

* Accessing the websites to find the perfect holiday 

* Allow the user to follow a dream and a passion

* Nice design that allows each user to move around the site comfortably.

* Clean, clear and easy to use.



### UX

- I drew up various mock wireframes and initially had a a jumobotron header with a white background and then the 9 images on top. 
- It wasn't bold enough and so a single blown up image with a colourful picture I feel gives it a much bigger impact when viewed by
- a user.

## Original concepts

 


- There will always be bold adventurers looking for something new. Watching the amazing documentary Free Solo, it showcased how far someone
- will go to fill that need and addiction for something different. I wanted this site to be bold, colourful but all in one neat and easy to use
- place. Design and Conquer is a website I was going to add to my portfolio from years ago but I neved made it. As a project, I thought this was
- perfect to use for the holiday allowance project for the course and allows me to showcase what I've learnt.

### Site Interactivity and Features



# Tech Used

* HTML
* CSS 
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/start)
* Javascript




## The goals for the website are:

*

## Ideal site visitors



## This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:

The website has one page that has all navigation and options direct from the one page.
## This website is:

Easy to navigate through.

Allows the user to work through the site with an easy to understand front end design.
Provides the user the information they need without it being overwhelming.
Booking forms and Get in touch forms are clear and concise for when the user wants to book a holiday


## Deployment

This project was developed using the Cloud9 development software and then stored in git using the Cloud9 platform.

The project was regularly pushed to GitHub repository https://github.com/Mattlister/designandconquer/commits/master and 
published to GitHub pages using the GitHub settings.

### Deployment to Github

I used and configured GitHub Pages to publish my site's source files from my master branch folder named the-band. This is in Cloud9 folder 
for all my Project Pages that were under that umbrella.

Publishing my source files is dependent on my site type as in what language the code is developed in and the site type I have in 
my repository.

To enable my GitHub Pages to be published, I have a master branch in my repository.

To access my GitHub Pages site's repository.

I access my repository name and click Settings.

Repository settings button

Use the Select source drop-down menu to select master or gh-pages as your GitHub Pages publishing source.

select-gh-pages-or-master-as-source

* Click Save.

* I then Published my GitHub Pages site from my docs folder in my master branch and published the source files from the 
  docs folder in my master branch. I had to have a master branch containing all the data.

* GitHub Pages reads everything when publishing a site, including the CNAME file, from the /docs folder. Every change is updated
 so every step taken and evey edit is documented.


I used default commands to push to Github such as:

* git status when checking what needed uploading.
* git commit -m "" with the named update between the quotes for anyone reading what changes I made. A short piece of info helps understand
* the changes I make.
* git push -u origin master which then pushes my update and I then need to enter my username and password for security.


## Testing

I tested the website half way through the project on Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari. I was always using Google Chrome and found no issues when 
using this browser. The website worked to the normal standard on Mozilla Firefox as well. So far, So good. But, On Apple's Safari browser, there were bugs 
displayed. The images when hovered over as you'll see will flip and they'll be a grdient background with both a Location and Information button on the back.
When testing in Safari, the image flipped and stayed as the image but a mirrored version. When the buttons did show, it flipped the image back to the originally
and there was no maps or modals appearing. These are bugs I need to look into but this is a junction I came to mid project.


### Media and Content

The text, images and videos were found on various sites for each particular venture. 

* The content was taken and used in context from actual sites running these adventures for real and so their write up's were specific for the use of 
promoting the products.
* The images were searched and found on Google
* The videos were searched for and found on Google. I used Vimeo videos as they're clearer than YouTube videos.


### Code

* I've used various code for this website. As they say, a lazy programmer is a smart programmer so I used a fair amount of the code from my orignal 
* MS1 project, from Google Garage and from other locations. Please see a list below.

* HTML - All code produced by Matthew Lister except for the content such as videos and*  images. These were searched and found on Google Chrome and
then added into iframe and img source code which I had put together. The modal formts and forms were taken from my MS1 and edited to correspond
to the needs of this website. I used script tags from Google Fonts to display the correct formatted fonts.

* CSS - All CSS code was produced by Matthew Lister originally typed to add styling to the HTML page. This included Font styling, image sizing and
colour choices except for the gradients for the back of the flip boxes. This can be found at: http://www.annenbergdl.org/tutorials/easy-breezy-beautiful-css-gradients/
which helps add so much more to the back of the flip boxes. Once I had the code typed up, I ran it through Autoprefixer to clean up and resolve any
breaks which did help in regards to displaying on various sized devices.
 

* JavaScript - Some of the code for this was produced by Matthew Lister based on learning material from the code insitute course. I also used code
from google garage which I used to create the code to fetch data fro JSON. The mapping section was imported and edited from google maps API's.


* JSON - The code was produced using information found online on how to produce a JSON file. Once I had the basis, I added more informtion to the 
file to hold multiple markers that will display on the map.





### Acknowledgements

I'd like to say than you to My mentor Simen Daehlin who has supported me through the project and has been a great influence and inspired me to
keep going, especially when I really was ready to throw in the towel but a 10:30 call at niht helped get me back on track. The Slack
community reviewed my code and pointed out issues/ offered advice to aide me in improving my sites to produce something greater and so I'm 
really grateful for their consistent support and it's good to know we're in this together. I'd also like to say a big thank you to Anna Greaves, 
Anthony O'Brien and Shane Muirhead for their help in regard to issues I had with my JSON code and indepth code reviews.
