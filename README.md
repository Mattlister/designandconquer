# Design & Conquer Website



[My page](https://mattlister.github.io/The-Monkees-Monkees/)


The project I’ve designed is for my second milestone project for the Interactive FrontEnd Design and Development module of the 
Full Stack Developer Course. I’ve used Bootstrap to design the HTML layout of the website. This is to provide functionality and a 
responsive design which sits in an HTML shell with added elements of CSS to add styling. This is a Single Page Applciation (SPA Respectively)
adventure holiday booking website.




### How I’d like the website to be perceived:

* A site that anyone can use. They can choose their adventure all from one location.

* They've seen the locations on TV or in magazines and this is where the user can start their dream.

* A nice clean UX design site all sat in one location. Click and point revolving images provide more information and the user never
* leaves the cool holiday home page. Design & Conquer.


### [Home Page](https://mattlister.github.io/The-Monkees-Monkees/index.html)

Being a SPA, you never leave the one page. You can do everything all one place and so I've added all the necessary features on the home page.


### Hopes for the website are:

I made the website for the fans and tried to make it look up to date with easy to use functionality. I also like to think it could be a good base 
platform website as you can link here and then go on to other pages to find more in depth information, opportunities to purchase memorabilia and 
follow the band as the remaining members continue to tour. I wanted the site to be easy to use for all users of all ages and so to:

* Showcase the band 

* Allow the user to follow them, purchase items or arrange private bookings

* Nice design that allows each user to move around the site comfortably. This is designed for fans of all ages.

* Clean, clear and easy to use.




### UX

- I drew up various mock wireframes and initially had a 

- My initial design was all done by hand with a layout in mind. When I first started my project and spoke to my Mentor, I had 
  various ideas of how I wanted the page to look with a strong background image to showcase the look of the band. Showing 
  togetherness and them at the height of their career. The black and white image provided from course material I found 
  to be perfect, it’s clean, crisp and there seems to be passion behind the photo. 

- The movement of the page is subtle but sharp and the static image against a moving page adds a professional element to the site. 

- The Monkees will always have older fans naturally due to when they were popular and so this site has been developed with that in mind. 
  A user of any age could easily find their way around and the pages aren’t overloaded with information. There’s short simple info pieces 
  about the band members for a user but the option to find out more is available via the social media links. Newer fans can use these links 
  to get to each page and so YouTube, Facebook and Twitter page are available to find tour dates, hear their music and purchase merchandise 
  direct.

### Site Interactivity and Features

Interactivity has been a key feature for the website. There's working Modals on each page which are accessible via buttons. The Modal
card that appears then contains a new snippet of inormation that refrences the band. Also, there's a working playable video on the homepage
for their classic hit "Daydream Believer"

Across the entire site, each page has Modal cards. Each card shows an image, information or a list. On the contact us page, there's a working
form and a contact us page.


# Tech Used

* CSS

## The goals for the website are:

* To promote The Monkees as a band and showcase their music.
* To show them in their youth at the height of their career.
* The ability to contact the band and book them for events or purchase music and other merchandise from them.
* A simple UX design which opens new and old fans to the band so they can enjoy their music for the first time or fall in love with them all over again.

The customer goals of this website are:

## Ideal site visitors

Someone wanting to discover an era of music which will never be forgotten for the 60's still define music today.
A person who still follows the band and would like to contact them and find out what they're up to and where they're playing.

## This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:

The website has touring pages which showcases where they're playing. The website works as a portal as there are social media links
on each page which takes a user to the bands more indepth pages.

## This website is:

Easy to navigate through.

Allows the user to work through the site with an easy to understand front end design.
Provides the user the information they need without it being overwhelming.
Booking forms and Get in touch forms are clear and concise if you wanted to book the band. Modal cards are easy to read through as well.


## Deployment

This project was developed using the Cloud9 development software and then stored in git using the Cloud9 platform.

The project was regularly pushed to GitHub repository https://github.com/Mattlister/The-Monkees-Monkees and 
published to GitHub pages using the GitHub settings.

### Deployment to Github

I used and configured GitHub Pages to publish my site's source files from my master branch folder named the-band. This is in Cloud9 folder 
for all my Project Pages that were under that umbrella.

Publishing my source files is dependent on my site type as in what language the code is developed in and the site type I have in 
my repository.

To enable my GitHub Pages to be published, I have a master branch in my repository.

To access my GitHub Pages site's repository.

I access my repository name and click Settings.

Repository settings button

Use the Select source drop-down menu to select master or gh-pages as your GitHub Pages publishing source.

select-gh-pages-or-master-as-source

* Click Save.

* I then Published my GitHub Pages site from my docs folder in my master branch and published the source files from the 
  docs folder in my master branch. I had to have a master branch containing all the data.

* GitHub Pages reads everything when publishing a site, including the CNAME file, from the /docs folder. Every change is updated
 so every step taken and evey edit is documented.


I used default commands to push to Github such as:

* git status when checking what needed uploading.
* git commit -m "" with the named update between the quotes for anyone reading what changes I made. A short piece of info helps understand
* the changes I make.
* git push -u origin master which then pushes my update and I then need to enter my username and password for security.


## Testing

Testing information can be found in my [TESTING.MD](https://github.com/Mattlister/The-Monkees-Monkees/blob/master/TESTING.md) file

### Content

The text for each page was taken from the band members wikipedia pages and touring pages and then edited by Matthew Lister.

All the images used in this site were provided by Course Institite except for touring2 and touring3 which were taken from Google.

The video for my website was again provided by Code Institute as part of the course material.

### Code

Some CSS code and Bootstrap was originally taken from Bootstrap 4 and W3C Schools and then edited by Matthew Lister

### Acknowledgements

I'd like to say than you to My mentor Simen Daehlin who reviewed my site and helped me towards restructuring the entire website with Bootstrap 4
rather than 3 and advising me on new code I should have been using. I also want to say thank you to Anna Greaves who one day reviewed my site and 
advised me that I needed to make some drastic changes, helped me to kick start those changes and advised me on speaking to Simen.
