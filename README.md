A Single Page Application for anyone looking to conquer their next Big Adventure!!

The project I’ve designed is for my second milestone project for the Interactive FrontEnd Design and Development module of the 
Full Stack Developer Course. I’ve used Bootstrap to design the HTML layout of the website. This is to provide functionality and a 
responsive design which sits in an HTML shell with added elements of CSS to add styling. This is a Single Page Applciation (SPA Respectively)
adventure holiday booking website. The user can use the images to display an API map and see information on each page. There's a "What we do 
and how to book" option at the top of the page where the user can enquire and book holida destinations using the request and booking form 
that will show them how to book and what's available.

### How I’d like the website to be perceived:


* This website would be an easy to use adventure holiday booking site which can be accessed all from one easy location.

* They've seen the locations on TV or in magazines and this is where the user can start their dream holiday.

* A nice clean UX single page design site all sat in one location. Click and point revolving images provide more information and the user never

* leaves the cool holiday home page. Design & Conquer.


# Project Goals

The primary goal of Design and Conquer is a single page application where a user can book an adventure holiday. As the title indicates, the user
is able to "design" the advneture and then "conquer" it. There are 9 options on the home page to choose from but an optional form is under the
What We Do? section where a user can change choose a holiday if needed. The user can watch videos on each slide and read information about the 
location. There's also a Help Guide on the home page which explains the website.

# User Goals

The website has been designed for people that want to try a new type of holiday that's not on the normal scale. It's also designed for people
who want to add to their list of adventures and try something new. 


### [Home Page](https://github.com/Mattlister/designandconquer)

Being a SPA, you never leave the one page. You can do everything all in one place and so I've added all the necessary features on the home page.

* All revolving images have an information button about the location and holiday and a map which shows where the area is.


### Hopes for the website are:

A user can use the site with ease and simplicity to the page:

* Accessing the websites to find the perfect holiday 

* Allow the user to follow a dream and a passion

* Nice design that allows each user to move around the site comfortably.

* Clean, clear and easy to use.



### UX

- I drew up various mock wireframes and initially had a a jumobotron header with a white background and then the 9 images on top. 
- It wasn't bold enough and so a single blown up image with a colourful picture I feel gives it a much bigger impact when viewed by
- a user.

## Original concepts

- There will always be bold adventurers looking for something new. Watching the amazing documentary Free Solo, it showcased how far someone
- will go to fill that need and addiction for something different. I wanted this site to be bold, colourful but all in one neat and easy to use
- place. Design and Conquer is a website I was going to add to my portfolio from years ago but I neved made it. As a project, I thought this was
- perfect to use for the holiday allowance project for the course and allows me to showcase what I've learnt.

### Site Interactivity and Features



# Tech Used

* HTML
* CSS 
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/start)
* Javascript




## The goals for the website are:

*

## Ideal site visitors



## This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:

The website has one page that has all navigation and options direct from the one page.
## This website is:

Easy to navigate through.

Allows the user to work through the site with an easy to understand front end design.
Provides the user the information they need without it being overwhelming.
Booking forms and Get in touch forms are clear and concise for when the user wants to book a holiday


## Deployment

This project was developed using the Cloud9 development software and then stored in git using the Cloud9 platform.

The project was regularly pushed to GitHub repository https://github.com/Mattlister/designandconquer/commits/master and 
published to GitHub pages using the GitHub settings.

### Deployment to Github

I used and configured GitHub Pages to publish my site's source files from my master branch folder named the-band. This is in Cloud9 folder 
for all my Project Pages that were under that umbrella.

Publishing my source files is dependent on my site type as in what language the code is developed in and the site type I have in 
my repository.

To enable my GitHub Pages to be published, I have a master branch in my repository.

To access my GitHub Pages site's repository.

I access my repository name and click Settings.

Repository settings button

Use the Select source drop-down menu to select master or gh-pages as your GitHub Pages publishing source.

select-gh-pages-or-master-as-source

* Click Save.

* I then Published my GitHub Pages site from my docs folder in my master branch and published the source files from the 
  docs folder in my master branch. I had to have a master branch containing all the data.

* GitHub Pages reads everything when publishing a site, including the CNAME file, from the /docs folder. Every change is updated
 so every step taken and evey edit is documented.


I used default commands to push to Github such as:

* git status when checking what needed uploading.
* git commit -m "" with the named update between the quotes for anyone reading what changes I made. A short piece of info helps understand
* the changes I make.
* git push -u origin master which then pushes my update and I then need to enter my username and password for security.


## Testing

I tested the website half way through the project on Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari. I was always using Google Chrome and found no issues when 
using this browser. The website worked to the normal standard on Mozilla Firefox as well. So far, So good. But, On Apple's Safari browser, there were bugs 
displayed. The images when hovered over as you'll see will flip and they'll be a grdient background with both a Location and Information button on the back.
When testing in Safari, the image flipped and stayed as the image but a mirrored version. When the buttons did show, it flipped the image back to the originally
and there was no maps or modals appearing. These are bugs I need to look into but this is a junction I came to mid project.

### Acknowledgements

I'd like to say than you to My mentor Simen Daehlin who reviewed my site and helped me towards restructuring the entire website with Bootstrap 4
rather than 3 and advising me on new code I should have been using. I also want to say thank you to Anna Greaves who one day reviewed my site and 
advised me that I needed to make some drastic changes, helped me to kick start those changes and advised me on speaking to Simen.
